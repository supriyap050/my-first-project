    <h3>Flipkart</h3>
    <p>
      Online shopping is a form of electronic commerce which allows consumers to directly buy goods or services from a
      seller over the Internet using a web browser or a mobile app. Consumers find a product of interest by visiting the
      website of the retailer directly or by searching among alternative vendors using a shopping search engine, which
      displays the same product's availability and pricing at different e-retailers. As of 2020, customers can shop
      online
      using a range of different computers and devices, including desktop computers, laptops, tablet computers and
      smartphones.
      Online stores that evoke the physical analogy of buying products or services at a regular "brick-and-mortar"
      retailer or shopping center follow a process called business-to-consumer (B2C) online shopping. When an online
      store is set up to enable businesses to buy from another business, the process is instead called
      business-to-business
      (B2B) online shopping. A typical online store enables the customer to browse the firm's range of products and
      services,
      view photos or images of the products, along with information about the product specifications, features and
      prices.
      Unlike physical stores which may close at night, online shopping portals are always available to customers.

    <h3>History</h3>
    <p>
      One of the earliest forms of trade conducted online was IBM's online transaction processing (OLTP) developed in
      the 1960s,
      which allowed the processing of financial transactions in real-time.[2] The computerized ticket reservation system
      developed
      for American Airlines called Semi-Automatic Business Research Environment (SABRE) was one of its applications.
      There, computer
      terminals located in different travel agencies were linked to a large IBM mainframe computer, which processed
      transactions
      simultaneously and coordinated them so that all travel agents had access to the same information at the same
      time.[2] At some
      point between 1971 and 1972, students at Stanford and MIT used the internet precursor ARPANET to make a deal to
      exchange marijuana,
      but the interaction does not qualify as e-commerce because no money was transferred online.[3]
    </p>

    <h3>Customers</h3>
    <p>
      Online customers must have access to the Internet and a valid method of payment in order to complete a
      transaction. Generally,
      higher levels of education and personal income correspond to more favorable perceptions of shopping online.
      Increased exposure
      to technology also increases the probability of developing favorable attitudes towards new shopping channels.[21]
      In addition, age is also a significant factor that affects online shopping. People feel that privacy and security
      factors have an even more
      significant impact on attitudes toward online shopping than product factors. Shoppers of different age groups have
      different perceptions of
      the risk factors of online shopping
